/** http.ClientRequest - This object is created internally and returned from http.request(). It represents an
  * in-progress request whose header has already been queued. The header is still mutable using the setHeader(name,
  * value), getHeader(name), removeHeader(name) API. The actual header will be sent along with the first data chunk or
  * when closing the connection.
  *
  * To get the response, add a listener for 'response' to the request object. 'response' will be emitted from the
  * request object when the response headers have been received. The 'response' event is executed with one argument
  * which is an instance of http.IncomingMessage.
  *
  * During the 'response' event, one can add listeners to the response object; particularly to listen for the 'data'
  * event. If no 'response' handler is added, then the response will be entirely discarded. However, if you add a
  * 'response' event handler, then you must consume the data from the response object, either by calling response.read()
  * whenever there is a 'readable' event, or by adding a 'data' handler, or by calling the .resume() method. Until the
  * data is consumed, the 'end' event will not fire. Also, until the data is read it will consume memory that can
  * eventually lead to a 'process out of memory' error.
  *
  * Note: Node.js does not check whether Content-Length and the length of the body which has been transmitted are equal
  * or not.
