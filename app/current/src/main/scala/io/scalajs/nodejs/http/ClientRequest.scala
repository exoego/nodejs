/**
  * http.ClientRequest - This object is created internally and returned from http.request(). It represents an in-progress
  * request whose header has already been queued. The header is still mutable using the setHeader(name, value),
  * getHeader(name), removeHeader(name) API. The actual header will be sent along with the first data chunk or when
  * closing the connection.
  *
  * To get the response, add a listener for 'response' to the request object. 'response' will be emitted from the request
  * object when the response headers have been received. The 'response' event is executed with one argument which is an
  * instance of http.IncomingMessage.
  *
  * During the 'response' event, one can add listeners to the response object; particularly to listen for the 'data' event.
  * If no 'response' handler is added, then the response will be entirely discarded. However, if you add a 'response'
  * event handler, then you must consume the data from the response object, either by calling response.read() whenever
  * there is a 'readable' event, or by adding a 'data' handler, or by calling the .resume() method. Until the data is
  * consumed, the 'end' event will not fire. Also, until the data is read it will consume memory that can eventually
  * lead to a 'process out of memory' error.
  *
  * Note: Node.js does not check whether Content-Length and the length of the body which has been transmitted are equal or not.
